what do I want to learn or understand better?
-Right now I want to improve on finding things people need, meaning cool ideas for this project. This is a very useful thing to learn for the future as engineers job is about
solving problems for others and yourself ofcourse.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-Right now I can mostly help the IE students to understand Github and programming (if they need help that is). Other than that it is still too early to say
which parts I will understand better which I therefore can show for the entire team.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
-We haven't really gotten started so therefore my contribution right now is by reading and increasing my knowledge about the framework.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
-We haven't gotten started yet with the product so I have been focusing on thinking of a cool idea for the project, that has been my contribution so far for deliveries.
