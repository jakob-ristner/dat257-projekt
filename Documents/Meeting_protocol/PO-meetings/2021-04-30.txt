* Tobias Lindberg is infosec at neonatal hemsjukvård.

* We show what we've done this week. They seem very happy. 
    - want to continue with the next part of the project now. 
    - Are talking about a new document that they might want to 
    add to this project. We will think about this to future meetings.

not. Tobias will give us a document that detailes laws and rules in 
Sweden.
