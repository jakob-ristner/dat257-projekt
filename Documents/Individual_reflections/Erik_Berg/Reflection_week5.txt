INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION 
Erik Berg 
week5

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I have learned a lot about how React works and also a bit about how to 
do some css. I also feel like I've been much better at following the agile processes.
However I still feel like I can improve in that regard. Next week I would like to 
understand the code that everyone else has written, and simoultaniously comment
the code so that everyone can understand what we have written. 

* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I believe that I was helpful this week with git things. Things like merging and branches. 
My belief is that during the next week I can be helpful in getting the team up to speed
with the code that me and my coding partner has written, and also I think that 
me and my coding partner will continue to have a good exchange of information and coding 
practises. 

* what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
My contribution towards the team's use of Scrum consists mostly this week of writing tasks
and making sure that we we're working based on the tasks and not the other way around. 
I would like to help in  the testing aspect of the code next week since that is something
we've missed up until now and it's a big thing in Scrum to always review the things we've
done. I hope I also can help motivate the team on the testing side of things. 

* What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I've written code for the discharge side of the registration page. I've also done
some of the minor tasks and feedback that we got from our last customer meeting. Next week I
would like to do some deliveries that are more focused on the developer side of things. Things
like code cleanup and code commenting and things like that. This to ensure that what we've 
written is understandable and easy to get into.
