INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION
Erik Berg
week 6

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
There hasn't been a lot of learning this week since the tasks I was assigned to 
was more in line with things I had done before. However what I did learn was 
about how to structure react code and more specifically how good react is at 
combining javascript and HTML. Next week I would like to learn more about how
our css and about how css in general works. To do this I will try to get assigned
to tasks that consists of css work. 

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I believe that still programming is my strongest suit and therefore that 
that is the area in which i can help my teammembers best. I hope that I've
been helpful in the team-programming with Anton, and I hope that I can continue
with this in future weeks. 

* What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
My contribution this week towards Scrum has been taking part in
testing and code review, and following the trello board. I think this
is a good strategy and I will continue doing this in the future. 

* What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I've been working on the add digitalt vårdmöte page. We completed
all tasks that we we're assigned to and thus have done a good contribution
to the deliveries this week.
