*   what do I want to learn or understand better?
	As of now, I feel that I've understood much more about both react and postgresql. 
	It has been a bit of a learning curve as I've never used postgres or react before. 

	I want to understand more about web development and how to style forms and grids in
	HTML and react so that the product that we are producing also looks nice and isn't
	just input fields everywhere. I believe that during the next week I will learn a lot 
	more about react and how to connect stuff. 

*   how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	I still believe that my strenghts are on the programming side of things, however
	I think that if I can teach about git, or react or JS, then I can get taught
	how to do things in postgres. 

*   what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	I've been active in updating the team's Trello board. However there has been a few issues
	with the user stories or more precisely the tasks that they weren't defined enough. This
	has been addressed with everyone and I hope that I can make better user stories and tasks
	for the coming week. The main problem was that nobody knew really how we were supposed to 
	implement things and therefore the tasks were fairly vague. This will be better and I will 
	try to write better stories. 

*   what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I and Haris did the registration page of the website together. We did not quite finish
	the whole page but we very nearly got there. Next week I have as of yet no idea what I will
	be working on but I hope that I get to code a bit more on the website, and hopefully I can
	finish the implementation of the registration page.
