* What do I want to learn or understand better?

Since this is the first week of the course, I don't really have any concrete 
goals other than to find something to work on. One thing I would like to use this
course for though is to try my hands on maybe a new programming language or a new 
library. 

* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We will have to teach the whole team about Git since that will become our 
online repository manager. I think I can contribute with programming abilities and 
be helpful in the management and setup of the project. 

* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We haven't started using scrum yet so I leave this question blank for now. 

* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have contributed to the social contract and currently I'm trying to come up with a good idea 
and to be helpful in the setup of the project. In the future I believe that we will have 
an idea and that I can contribute with ideas of how to implement this first idea.
