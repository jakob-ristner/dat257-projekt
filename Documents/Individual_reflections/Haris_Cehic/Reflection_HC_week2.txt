Individual reflection - Haris Cehic
Week 2 2/4

What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week we have learnt more theory about Scrum and the process. We also got the chance to apply the theory in practice. First we had a team exercise building objects in Minetest where we had multiple sprints. Also we got the chance to develop user stories. What I would like to learn more about is how to apply Scrum more concrete in our project with all the planning, reflection etc. Also it would be interesting to work with our product owner and develop the product with them. To reach this I think we simply need to get going with the project but also read up more on the details of Scrum. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Under the week I have tried to help others and share my knowledge. An example was that half of the group had experiences about creating a Business Model Canvas and we could share that with the rest of the group. Whereas the other part had knowledge in tools to use for software development that they shared with us. In the future I would like to share more of my knowledge by actively making sure everybody understands each task.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I’ve been participating in the team exercises where we got the chance to try it for the first time. Also we planned the sprint in the beginning of the week and also had a reflection at the end of the sprint to really make use and learn the concept.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I’ve been active in all the meetings where we planned and took decisions. Also was part of developing the Business Model Canvas and discussing the Mockup with the product owner.
