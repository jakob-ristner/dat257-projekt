Individual reflection 2021-04-30

what do I want to learn or understand better?
-For this week we have decided to focus on the website layout, therefore my goal is getting better at that. I also want to learn how to do module-css.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-Right now I can help people understand css better since I've gotten a hang of it, in the future I want to get even better at css. Other than  that I can contribute with my
programming skills per usual. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
-This week my contirbution has been making tasks and userstories on mondays, worked on them during the week and evaluated how it went. I still have the main role of 
communicating with out product owner. In the future I want to become better att making userstories and tasks. We also started with code reviews this week which was extremely helpful for our scrum process, making sure that there is no bugs before putting our tasks in the done section.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
-This week me and Nima firstly worked on fixing our handling on null values in our database. We also made a setup file for all our sql files. We also worked on html constraints
in registration and discharge which was needed, using Jakob Ristners util functions. Lastly we started working on css in edit hembesok.
