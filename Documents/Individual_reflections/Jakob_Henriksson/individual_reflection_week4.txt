Individual reflection 2021-04-16 13-51

what do I want to learn or understand better?
-After a week I still feel that I want to improve my understanding of react! I also would like to understand the PERN (postgres, express, react ,node) connection better! Other than that I feel that improving our trello user stories and tasks is a must. My goal this until the next reflection is therefore ->Improving trello, improve my understanding of PERN and react.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-As of now I can contribute with my skills in programming in react but I am yet not a master myself. Other than that I'm starting to understand CSS well now and therefore I can help with that. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
-This week my contirbution has mostly been working with trello(userstory, tasks etc). Our userstories have been suboptimal because they have been rather vague instead of helpful, this goes for tasks aswell. I have also worked in a development team with Nima which has gone well. I still have the role of being the main contact with our customer.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
-I had issues understanding react the first day but now I am back on track. This week me and Nima have fixed all navigation buttons which will be used on most pages which has been fun and challenging. Me and Nima has also started working on styling the buttons and grouping them using grid which has been alot of fun and a useful way of organizing our components to the page.
