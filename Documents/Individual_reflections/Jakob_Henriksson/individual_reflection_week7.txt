Individual reflection 2021-05-07

what do I want to learn or understand better?
-This week I want to continue learning weblayout and css since I've realized there is so much to learn, in the future I want to be able to make good css structures. In the fututure
I also want to be able to understand how to properly use 'inspect' on the web.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-As of this week I can start helping other people with css aswell, not to the greatest extent but for people to get a hang of it. In the future I want to be able to give precise and useful
information for quality css.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
-This week I've been working with user stories and tasks per usual, I've also reviewed some of our code and given my input. One of the harder things this week was writing userstories for css 
which can defiently be improved. Therefore my goal next week is to write more precise userstories and tasks for css. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
-This week I've been programming with Mohammad on add form css. This week has been one of the roguher ones since our PO wanted to make some changes after our delivery on thursday which
lead to extra work during thursday to make it to friday. Therefore it has been kind of stressful and my delivery towards the end product hasn't been the best. The plus side is that we
got feedback from our PO right away so we had time to change it and that they got to see another take on how the forms could be filled.
