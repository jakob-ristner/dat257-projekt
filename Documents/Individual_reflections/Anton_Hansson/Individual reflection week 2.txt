Individual Reflection Anton week 2 

What do I want to learn or understand better?

	I want to get a better understanding of how to plan sprints and create user stories that are relevant and feasible. 
	I also want to figure out which programs we need to use in order to develop out product 
	and see what I can do to prepare myself before the first sprint that starts after the Easter break

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

	I can be reachable and bounce ideas with the other team members so that we all understand the project's scope and what's needed before next week.
	I can also take a look at possible user stories and discuss them with my teammates
	
What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
	
	I participated in the MineTest-exercise on Monday where we practised scrum and working agile. 
	I have increased my knowledge about scrum from different sources and the lectures. This will surely prove to be useful in the following stages of our project.
 	
What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

	This week I've been participating in the group meetings actively as well as the MineTest-exercise.
	I have contributed to the business model canvas and asked questions to understand the scope of our project better.
