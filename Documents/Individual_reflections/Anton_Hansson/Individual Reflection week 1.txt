Individual Reflection Anton week 1 

What do I want to learn or understand better?

	I want to learn how to work in an agile manner and improve my ability to work with a team of people from different backgrounds.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

	I can make sure to listen to all my team members and make sure that everyone gets to speak their mind. 
	Hopefully, this creates an environment where all members can speak openly and dare to ask for help when needed.
	
What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
	
	I haven't been able to contribute to our use of scrum yet. But I've looked at some websites and youtube to 
	understand the concept better. I've also spoken to a friend who works as a software developer about how 
	they use scrum at his workplace in order to get more knowledge about the concept. 
	
What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

	It's only the first week. So far I've contributed with the social contract together with the whole group.
