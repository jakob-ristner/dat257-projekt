Individual Reflection Anton week 6 

What do I want to learn or understand better?

    This week I've worked on a view similar to the first sprint. This made it much easier to develop and without any big
    issues. I have done some css grid for the first time which was interesting. Next week we'll work more with the layout part so 
    I feel that I need to learn more css in order to understand all parts that are needed to complete the next userstories. 
    I will use google, youtube and ask my teammates to understand css better and contribute to our team deliveries next sprint.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

    I can help my teammates by coding together and discuss suitable soultions on our tasks.
    I feel that code reviewing is a great way to help each other out. As well as discussions when the whole group is present
    during monday meetings or the sprint reflection on fridays. 

What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
	
    This week we've added code review to our definition of done and together with testing this makes us work more agile.
    I am part of all the effort estimations and when we reflect upon the last sprint in order to improve next sprint. 
    I like the agile workstrategy and feel like I'm starting to understand it on a deeper level compared to the first week of the course. 
 	
What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
	
    I coded together with Erik this week and we worked on add digitalt vårdmöte. The cooperation worked well and we 
    completed all of our tasks. We also discussed and identified bugs from previous sprints which is an important part of 
    ensuring code quality.
