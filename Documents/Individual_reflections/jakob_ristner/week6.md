##what do I want to learn or understand better?
How to use class components in react, we have almost only been using functional 
components so far. They have there benefits and disatvantages but this week
I want to look into class components, I feel as though the slightly less
amount of asynchronous programming will be less of a headache in many cases.

##how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week i am working in a group of three, one team member in this group
has been contributing slightly less than expected. Because of this i will
try to as "pedagogisk" as possible.

##what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Continuing to try to evaluate our user story and task creation as a team. 
Trying to evaluate how our KPIs have correlated with actual amount delivered and
trying to factor in how we are all getting used to coding in javascript.

##What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
When I created the "hello world" skeleton, I had to do a lot
of reasearch on express/js/react which has rendered me in 
a position where i know slightly more about it than my group.
I want to continue to use this as a base for educating everyone
and bringing everyone to the same level, that is my goal at least.
