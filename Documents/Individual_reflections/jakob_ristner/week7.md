Individual reflection 2021-05-07

##what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week we have decided to focus more on design, but i will not be working on that. I will still be creating features but i still want to learn from them.
My goals are to be involved in their process.


##How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
There is only really one thing for the whole team to learn this week, that is css modules with react. I have no idea
how to write those, even if i wont be programming css, i can still contribute by learning how to use css modules


##What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Contributing as usual to the creation of user stories, i wish the whole team was more involved in all
of the discussions though. To acheive this i wish to use my role as scum master to involve everyone
on the important questions regarding reflection. As a scrum master i also want to monitor how our team functions when
one team only consists of one person.



##What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Contributing more to the creation of minor forms. Specifically editing the 
digitalt vårdmöte.
