Individual reflection 2021-05-13

##what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week we have had a lot less specific work. My goal right now is to
gain a larger grasp of the program as a whole, this far I know
a lot about the specific things that i have been working on but.
Since working on some things that other people wrote this week, i have
realized that there is much i don't fully understand and so that is my goal.

##how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Try to be as active as possible in the help channels, i spend a lot
of time helping people with bugs and issues but i feel like i need
to set specific time slots where i can be available in discord

##what is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Still evaluating our user story and task break down and KPI's, i feel
like we are definetely getting better at it but we need to get better at
reflecting on it. I feel as though that could rocket boost our performance.

##what is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week i worked with Erik and programmed some forms for
the mottagninsbes√∂k. We also created an abstracted utulity function
for HTML validating a specific type of "checkbox combo" where the
user is presented with several checkboxes and one text field. In this
case, at least one of the checkboxes needs to be filled in and if not, the 
text box must be typed in.
