I can use simple technical terminolgy, i also want to teach some people git and github as this can prevent workflow issues in the future.

I have taken initiative in creting a workspace chat as well as a trello page for the group.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Since we are in the very early stages of the project, the only thing i have contributed with is then social contract
