What do I want to learn or understand better?

I would still like to look over what we
previously have done to make sure that i understand everything, we will also document everything better which will help to learn more.
But otherwise this was our last sprint for this course and i feel that i have learned alot and i feel that my team members
contributed much to that so big up for them.

    
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

This was our last sprint so i cant really figure out something right now, next week we will write the last team reflection maybe i can
help by taking more responsibility there.

        
What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
	
I have contributed by participating on all team meetings and i have been creating user stories + tasks for the sprint. We also 
estimated our effort estimation much better this week, which made our team more effective. I relate this to our sprints and therefore scrum,
but maybe it fits better in "team deliveries"

    
What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
	
    Me Haris and Mohammad worked on the add function and edit function for återläggning. We worked every morning but we did not finish the whole sprint, but we will do it today (friday).
    Unfortunately we had some problems but thats something thats happens and something you need to count on.
