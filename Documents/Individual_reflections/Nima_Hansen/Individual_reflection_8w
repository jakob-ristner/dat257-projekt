What do I want to learn or understand better?

We have changed our focus for next week and will work more on functionality, i dont know exactly in terms of programming
what that will require so its hard for me to answer what i would like to learn. But i know we will set up a login page for the users, so we will
work on security also. So i would want to learn how to set up this login page on my own, and i would like to look over what we
previously have done to make sure i understand everything, for my own sake and for my team.

    
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

By asking questions and making team members think about ways to formalize the answer, i learn alot by explaning to others
and i hope they also learn from it. By documentating code, so others can understand what a specific code section contribute to.
 I try to help as much as i can when we get stuck in our coding, looking for small mistakes in the coding etc.

        
What is my contribution towards the team's use of scrum?
	
I have contributed by participating on all team meetings and i have been creating user stories + tasks for the sprint. 
We also made a form for the testing process which i contributed to with some inputs, which we use for testing.

    
What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
	
    Me Anton and Mohammad worked on the add function for Mottagningsbesok. It was a short sprint on three days but we managed to finish everything (maybe not the design but we sinze we changed our focus to functionality now its not prioritized).
    We could have done more but we had the final deadline of our Bachlour Thesis also this week and therefor im satisfied about how far we got on these 3 days.
