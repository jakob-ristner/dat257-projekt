What do I want to learn or understand better?
-	The aim of this course has become much more clear for me than before by participating on lectures, the sprints, scrum etc.
-	I also understand more about the aim of our project.
-	I would like to learn how to set a development environment and more about what that actually means, I think we decided to use “react” as this development environment, so I would like to learn more about this.
-	I still want to learn more about the actual programming and how you build a website from 0, but this is a pretty big goal.
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-	Of what I have seen this far, the IT students have very much more knowledge about programming than I, just by listening on them. Although everyone have not had a course in SQL, so I might be able to give some ideas and advices there.
What is my contribution towards the team´s use of scrum?
-	I haven´t done much there yet, but we haven´t really started with the project yet where the importance of scrum comes in.
What is my contribution towards the team´s deliveries?
-	I have contributed to the bussines canvas modell this week and been participating in discussions.
-	I will be contributing more next week when we start to write user stories, which we have already booked a day for.
