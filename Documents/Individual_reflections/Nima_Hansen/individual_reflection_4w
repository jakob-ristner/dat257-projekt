What do I want to learn or understand better?
-	i would still want to learn more about the react library
-   i would want to understand more of the code that we have written
-	I still want to learn more about the actual programming and how you build a website from 0, but this is a pretty big goal.
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-	Like last week, by being involved in the discussions and givining them my ideas, cant think of anything special right now.
What is my contribution towards the team´s use of scrum?
-	we are going to have a meeting today (friday) and then we may do something in scrum, but for now we haven´t changed anything since last reflection
What is my contribution towards the team´s deliveries?
-	I have contributed with the programming, me and jakob worked as a pair where we fixed the navigation buttons on the site and some layout things.
