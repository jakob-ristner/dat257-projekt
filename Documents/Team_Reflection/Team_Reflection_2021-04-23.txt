TEAM REFLECTION week 5
Secretary: Erik Berg

CUSTOMER VALUE and SCOPE
* Chosen scope of the application under development
including the priority of features and for whom you
are creating value:


*User Stories
	- This week we have been focused on breaking down 
	user stories into smaller and more clear defined tasks.
	We might need to work on acceptance criteria and DoD. 
	
	- We are using the Trello in the right way - by taking 
	tasks and doing them, instead of just coding and then looking
	at tasks. What could be better is how we are following the 
	DoD, more perticularily the testing aspect which we haven't done
	so much of. 

	- We will get better and better at creating tasks when we 
	know more how to code in react and how the code works. 

	- We made an effort estimation this week which is an improvement
	from last week when we didn't do one. However it felt like it wasn't
	quite the best estimation so hopefully in future weeks we will be able
	to make better effort estimations which are more accurate. 

* Acceptance Tests
	- We haven't done much testing or reaffirming of the acceptance
	criteria. We need to make sure that we are following the DoD
	and letting another person test the application. The goal for next
	week is that all finished tasks has been tested. 

* KPIs we use for monitoring the progress:
	- We haven't really thought about the KPIs since we set them up
	during the monday meeting. We need to actually adhere to the KPIs
	and as such need to track them more clearly. In the future we should
	go through all KPIs during the friday meeting to ensure that we are 
	tracking them. Another thing we should do is to mention them during 
	the monday meeting so that we are aware of them.

SOCIAL CONTRACT and EFFORT
* We skip this one this week since it hasn't changed
much since the last week. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESIGN DECISIONS and PRODUCT STRUCTURE
* Design decisions
	- We use a database and a web portal which makes it easy for the 
	customer to use the application on different OS:s and different
	devices. We feel that this might in the future help in the 
	integration into their oranisation since they can just host 
	the application on their intraNET. To reach this we try to 
	develop in a way that makes it easy to setup. 

* Technical Documentation
	- We do currently not use any technical documentation. This will make it
	very hard if we try to export the project. We should have some sort of 
	documentation. As a start during the next week we should begin commenting 
	the code everywhere.

	- We should probably also have some sort of structural diagram and a good 
	documentation in form of javaDocs or some other thing. 


* How we use the documentation
	- As we haven't documented very much we feel that we must skip this question.

* How to ensure code quality and enforce coding standards
	- As of now we do the programming in pairs which should help with 
	code quality. We should be better at enforcing coding standards and 
	ensuring the code quality. A way of doing this is to have code review
	as part of every sprint during the same time we test the code.

APPLICATION OF SCRUM
* We skip this one this week since we want a little more things to happen before we reflect
on our application of scrum.
