TEAM REFLECTION week 8
Secretary: Nima Hansen
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOMER VALUE and SCOPE

* Chosen scope of the application under development
including the priority of features and for whom you
are creating value: It has increased, one more "site" has been added, återläggning is bigger than we earlier thought.
 We know better now about
what they want to have in återläggning



*Success criteria
we have shifted our focus to the functionality rather than design when choosing our success criteria.


*User Stories
Has not really changed here either, but what we can say is that we worked better this week than the week before with the user stories.
But our effort estimation was very off.


* Acceptance test

* KPIs
 

    Userstories: 3/5 completed (done) 

    Tasks: 25/29 completed (done)

    Team Satisfaction: 8
    * we missjudged our effort estimation a bit and many team members which they could do more.
   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOCIAL CONTRACT and EFFORT
*social contract
Has not changed.

* time spent
This week, some of us feelt that they could have put more time this sprint, but it was very short (3 days).
But next week we aim to put more time at the sprint.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESIGN DECISIONS and PRODUCT STRUCTURE

* Design decisions


* Technical Documentation


* how you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints
    We have started documenting more,
    but we should make a overall documentation for the code in javadoc.

* how you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards
    We made a form for the testing process to ensure code quality.


   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APPLICATION OF SCRUM 

*Roles
Roles have not changed. The role of design responsible will not be as important next week as we will work less with design.

* Agile practice
Effort estimation was harder because of the sprint of 3 days, 

* the sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories?
 How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?) : 
  We reprioritized. and since we communicated very late about the "återläggnings" page we got
  had to rethink about how we would work with the return page. We should have asked about this earlier, which we take with us
  to the next sprints.

 * Ric wanted us to reprioritize and think more about the functionality than the design.
