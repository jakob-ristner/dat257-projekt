TEAM REFLECTION week 6
Secretary: Anton Hansson

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOMER VALUE and SCOPE

* Chosen scope of the application under development
including the priority of features and for whom you
are creating value:

Recently our scope has been expanded on, the customer has brought regional information security specialists who have
begun asking questions about how we handle the data. At the moment we are not storing personal data but since the
customer seems to want to store the birthdate of the babies, this might change and we may be subject to many laws.

Since the customer is very keen on having a working product at the end of this, they have begun thinking 
more about the piority of features.

*Success criteria
The goal of the project has always been to deliver an as complete product as possible but we
are probably not going to finish the project during this course. However this has been more
concretely put dureing the last meeting with the PO since the project is nearing its end. 

What we still need from them is a concrete definition of when the product is done from them since
we realize that we do not really know this right now.

*User Stories
This week the user story process has been a lot harder since we have worked on a lot of user stories focused on design.
We realized thet it is a lot more difficult creating and working from tasks in these design focused css sprints.
The acceptance critierias are also much more vague, all of which has contributed to what we feel has been a downgrade
in efficiancy and productivity.

Because of the nature of design, it was much harder to realize when any given element was finished.

To solve this issue we propose having stand up meetings where we discuss the design that we have worked on. 
This will however be very difficult to achieve next week since the sprint is only three days long.

* Acceptance test
We did the same thing as last week, we were however supposed to create a "cheat sheet" for testing and reviewing code 
but we forgot to do this. Next week we will create this cheat sheet just prior to the meeting together so that everybody 
gets something to say.

* KPIs
    Team satisfaction/happiness: Average 6,5
      *it is notable that very few team member enjoy writing css
      *teams that were writing css has lower satisfaction than code

    Userstories: 3/5 completed (done) 

    Tasks: 23/26 completed (done)
   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOCIAL CONTRACT and EFFORT
*social contract

We have not changed our social contract but we have applied it in the situation where a team member
was underperforming and it has worked well.

* time spent
This week, all of our team memmber from the Industrual Economy program have had their hands full on their
bachelors work. As a result of this, less time has been spent on the project this week and has resulted
in a less productive week than usual.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESIGN DECISIONS and PRODUCT STRUCTURE

* Design decisions
A lot has changed with the design since our last meeting with the PO. A layout for all of the 
minor forms has been settled on. We should draw up this design in figma so that everyone
working simultaniously has the same framwork to work after.

* Technical Documentation
We have started documenting some of our code this week but need to do more as well as document code from previous sprints.
It is also worth noting that the css has become compiclated wnought tow warrant being commented as well.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APPLICATION OF SCRUM 

*Roles
Roles have not changed

* Agile practice
This week, to try to be more productive, we hade two teams of 2 people and one team of 1 person. This is
a very shortsighted idea it has seamed. You get more code written in the same timespan but you lose the
element of helping eachother and just having somebody to code with and throw around ideas. This has been 
especially bad in the context of developing design elements in css where human input can be very valuable,
the enjoyment of this person was also very decreased. We will not be trying this out next week. 

*Best practices for learning
Something we should have looked at prior to starting to work with css a lot is to find some good
resource on how to structure and work with css in large react projects. As well as where to start.
